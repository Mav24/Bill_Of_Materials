- Need to add more style to the pages. was thinking of adding the valcom logo. But waiting until i get most of the coding done

- still need to add in the print page for the final create job page

- Issue that needs to be looked at where you are in the add line item page and when click out of the part description it auto puts a part Id in the box.

- Look in to issue where you can't close the create job page, because its checking for stock items
